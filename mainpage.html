<p>We should take care about ourselfs and our families to avoid the infection so we should follow the rules of doctors <br/>
Standard recommendations for reducing exposure to and transmission of a range of diseases include maintaining basic hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices, and avoiding close contact with anyone with respiratory symptoms such as coughing and sneezing, where possible.
<br/>
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will develop mild to moderate respiratory disease and recover without any special treatment being needed. Older people and those with underlying health problems such as cardiovascular disease , diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop severe illness.
<br/>Being well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads is the best way to avoid and slow down transmission. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or frequently using a rub based on alcohol, and not touching your face.<br/>
When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose, so it is important that you also practice respiratory etiquette for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow <br/>
At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.
